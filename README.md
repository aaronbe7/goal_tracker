# Goal Tracker
Goal Tracker is an app that helps users manage, create, and stick to their goals and resolutions. Users can create their own lists (e.g. Bucket List, Fitness Goals, New Year's Resolutions), then organize goals amonst those lists. The New Year is the inspiration for this goals and resolutions app.
